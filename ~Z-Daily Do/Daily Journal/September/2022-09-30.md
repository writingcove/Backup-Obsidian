Feelings
---
I woke up late again today - My life cycle is just so fucked.
I can't write, I can't code, what can I do? I feel like a useless piece of meat occupying space.
IDK what I want to do!
I want some quick results right now.\
	What will I do? Idk? maybe write an excerpt a day
at least I wrote some more of the short story, let's try to write more tomorrow.
I feel a little better organizing thing.
