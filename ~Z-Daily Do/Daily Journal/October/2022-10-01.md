- Went down to the Navratri event even though I dislike crowds with large number of people.
- I called brother to ask if there was something he wanted.
- I messaged Leo and made sure to have myself included in the credits.

Feelings
---
Though the waking up process took a lot of time and I woke up late, I am fine with it, because at least right now I don't feel that tiredness that I normally do. So I am happy that the meds maybe working. Will have to wait and see if this is the meds or just me.
I feel so burnt out, but I don't have a job and I am not doing anything other than trying to study and make a career out of this.
