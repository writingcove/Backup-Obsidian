 Hello there! I am an experienced content strategist and creative writer, having worked with two of the largest E-learning Institutes in India ( Great Learning and Intellipaat ), helping to deliver 300+ hours of content to over a million people through different mediums utilizing appropriate strategies. 

With every project, I plan, prototype, design and then deliver content , eventually   incorporating any feedback from clients or users to deliver a more intuitive experience in the next iteration. Each project follows a planned storyline to direct the flow and crux of that project in a very user friendly manner. 

I have years of delivering high-quality courses, articles, essays, videos, scripts, narratives in the e-learning domain, I hold a bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering which gives me an insight into techinncal content and better communicate ideas between content and technical fields if need be.
