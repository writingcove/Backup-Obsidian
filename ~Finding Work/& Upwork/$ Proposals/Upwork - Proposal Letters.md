Hey there, my name is Ram. As a Freelance Content Strategist and Creative writer, I like to focus on the user experience and planning out a storyline and putting it creatively in words for different kinds of mediums - Scripts, Articles, Essays, Videos, and Stories. Digital Marketing is a very important outreach method and requires careful crafting of the words and messages while maintaining a balance between what needs to be said and what is accepted. Researching on such topics and delivering within the given time constraints is an interesting prospect.

**Cover Letter**
	Hello there! My name is Ram, I work as a freelance content strategist and a creative writer. I specialize in planning out a storyline to direct the flow and crux of any piece I am working on, e.g.- Courses, Articles, Essays, Videos, and Scripts. I have experience working as a Content Strategist - for two of the largest E-Learning Institutes in india - in delivering Courses and other content.

**Describe your recent experience with similar projects**
	I have worked as a content strategist for two Very Large E-learning companies in India (Intellipaat & GreatLearning) and have helped them launch their YouTube Channels to have well over a million subscribers and 600,000 thousand subscribers respectively. I have had quite some experience creating Educational YouTube Videos - Planning them out, Doing research, creating content, and Writing their scripts out. If you would check my profile you will find some of my videos that have gone even above a million views on YouTube. Besides the YouTube part my job also usually entailed the creation of courses for the respective companies. example of my video and script writing - https://youtu.be/HIj8wU_rGIU


**How do you incorporate feedback and edits into your work?** 
	So in my process, I usually start by asking what are the specific requirements for the project I would be working on. I would create a prototype/draft with basics that are needed and push it for a semi-review with the client. If the client likes what kind of work is being done, I will finish the draft and fine-tune and then send it in for a final review.
