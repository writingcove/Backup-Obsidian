Hello, there fellow game devs! My name is Ram, I am a junior writer/Narrative designer. I love video games as a medium of storytelling and love to tell immersive stories that engross a player. I am currently working on an indie fantasy game project - [https://twitter.com/FourMoonsTM](https://twitter.com/FourMoonsTM) - as a writer and a narrative designer. I like to write SciFi, philosophical, Dystopia, fantasy, Eerie, horror, thriller, and Comedy. Though I don't have direct experience with Unity, I have worked with the GameMaker Engine and Twine for storytelling. I hold a bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering and I am familiar with C++ and Python, so I don't think it should be an issue. Here are some writing samples and game writing of mine: [https://ramendratripathi.github.io/#Portfolio](https://ramendratripathi.github.io/#Portfolio) I have also attached a piece of work below, for you to peruse. I would love to work on your project and help you build the best version of your vision and deliver an awesome game. Games I love and am inspired by - Nigth in the Woods, pyre, Freelancer, Metro 2033, Half-life, Spec ops the line, Hyper light drifter, Dawn of war.

-   **What engine are we using?** You are using UNITY - Naninovel Engine.
-   **What genre is our game?** I am not sure about this, as you haven't mentioned it in your job description. But it's something with a narrative focus, maybe akin to a visual novel as you are using naninovel.
