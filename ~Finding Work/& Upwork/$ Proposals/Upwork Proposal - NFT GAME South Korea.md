Hello, there fellow game devs! The NFT game market is sure growing fast, but it's good to see you are trying to add a narrative element to it. 

All right so a little about myself - My name is Ram, I am a junior writer/Narrative designer. I love video games as a medium of storytelling and love to tell immersive stories that engross a player. I am currently working on an indie fantasy game project - https://twitter.com/FourMoonsTM - as a writer and a narrative designer. I like to write SciFi, philosophical, Dystopia, fantasy, Eerie, horror, thriller, and sometimes Comedy. 

I have a familiarity with C#, C++, python, and engines like Unity, Game Maker and Twine, I also hold a bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering, so I usually take fast to new proprietary software.

I know you'd like to see some of my work, so here is a link to some writing samples and Game Writing of mine: https://ramendratripathi.github.io/#Portfolio .I have also attached a piece of work below, for you to peruse directly if that's what you would like.

I am a huge SciFi nerd and usually seek out media around it, so I can help you imagine and build the SciFi world revolving around your game.
 
Also, since it's usually difficult to get an idea about the other person from just the description itself, I have added a list of games that inspire me. So you can see for yourself If I am the right match for your vision or not. Games I love and am inspired by - HalfLife, Star Citizen, Freelancer, Halo CE & Reach, Prey, Bioshock, Hyper light drifter, FNV
