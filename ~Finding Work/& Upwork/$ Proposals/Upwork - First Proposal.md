Cover Letter
	Hi, My name is Ram, I am a creative writer looking to venture into the gaming industry as a professional. For a very long time I have had quite some interest in hiNarrative, especially in WW2 and what kind of events led to it and the consequences of such on our world. I have had some experience reasearching about the inner working of the nazi regime and soviet communist goverment of russia in the past for a personal project to rewrite wolfenstein into a better Narrative.
	
What world war topic can you write about?
	I  am interested in writing both about WW2 and WW1 but I know a lot more about the former than the latter. To be more specific, I can write about these topics as I understand them better than others mentioned -
	
		Legacy of WW1 -
			Discontent of Germany
			
		Rise of Totaliariasm -
			1. 2. 3.
			
		War -
			1. 2. 3. 4.
			
		Results -
			2. 3. 
			
		Impact -
			2. 3. 5.
			
		Rise of Superpowers -
			1. 2.
			
We will need 3 sets of stories that are interrated for the topic. What are your stories? They should flow nicely. For example Narrative 1 - background of Germany and rising issues. Narrative 2 - some events that triggered more disharmony. Narrative 3- final riots
	
	So I have structured these three naratives to help convey the descent of someone you would consider very human into evil.  How far are you willing to go to fullfill your ideals.

	Narrative 1 - Rise of Nazi germany - Narrative about a lost man(MC) who finds a place with the nazis. He reaquaints with his old friend from orphanage, who goes missing, so the MC sets out to find him. 
	
	Narrative 2 - German invasion of eastern europe - Narrative of the same man(MC), now attached with German National Railway, is sent out to the front to supervise railway repair and building for troops and secretly for perpetuating the holocaust.
	
	Narrative 3 - The last Narrative is set in the ruins of berlin in the final days of the battle of berlin. The same man is planning to escape from berlin to the american front. 
	

Note this is for a game with interactions with in-game characters. Who are the characters of your stories? How can the game player work with these characters?
	Narrative 1 characters - 
		The main character - Maximillian "Max" Muller/ (changed from Max berkowitz)
		Max's Friend - Helmut schmidt
		Helmut's sister - Edith schmidt
		
		Helmut is supposed to be the jusxtaposition to Max's views on german jews and nazi policies. Even though they both grew up in the same orphanage they were fostered by different families and hence the result of them being very different as adults, though still friends.
		
		Max's family was a rish jewish family, but his mother treated him like shit and beat him a lot. So he grew up disliking jews.
		As he grew up he left the house and started on his own, studying and finding a job as an aprentice mechanic. THough he lost it and was forced onto the streets. Thankfully the person that employed him previously took him in and helped him stay on his feet untill he could find another job. While in such a state the ideals of nazi party apealed to him and he joined the party. when they came to power in 1933 he was able to get a job very easily and even became a political officer that helped supervise.
		
		Helmut was adopted by nicer/richer parents, but he grew up to dislike nazi ideology and facism as mimicing his foster father's ideology.
		
		They btoh got in touch in the 1930s. They quickly reagained their friendship. 
		
		in the background as the important events take place, we see both our characters discuss the nature of the events and possible outcomes. They have a few fights, but nothing too serious. 
		 conflict arises after the day f postdamn, when hitler starts consolidating power and condeming communitsts. 
		 
		 helmut goes missing and when max eventually finds him, he's dead. Helmut is killed being a secret communist.
