Hey! Thanks for reaching out. What is your experience with animes / visual novels / mangas?


Oh, I absolutely love anime and manga, I have been watching as long as I can remember- Dragon Ball Z, Inuyasha, Captain harlock, Yu Yu haksho, neon evagelion, wolf's rain . Though I'd consider myself a manga guy, I tend to spoil stuff for my anime-only friends. 

anime movies - Cowboybebop,  ghost in the shell, your name, a silent voice, ghibli movies in general, angel's egg, jinroh wolf brigade

My favourite Anime of all time - Code geass ( It's got everything - drama, comedy, intrigue, scifi mechs, geopolitics and interesting philosophical questions) I also love gintama to death. Plastic memories is one that still makes me cry.

My favourite Manga's - The world God only Knows, Fullmetal Alchemist, Working!!, One punch man, Kaicho wa maid sama, sunken rock, junji ito's spiral, naruto, bleach(aizen saga only), gantz, cage of eden, attack on titan, toriko.

I like visual novels, some of my favourite games are Visual Novels Like - Pyre, VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender, and doki doki literature club. These are the ones I have gotten around to play. 

Sorry for bombarding you with so many names. haha. There are just too many to list that I like and love.

That's awesome, thanks so much for sharing. Just had a couple final questions:

Are you familiar with the Naninovel framework? Your role is to put the scenes together which includes the (light) technical activity of syntaxes (if statements, set variables...etc). You can take a review here to see how it's done. It's quite simple but just want to make sure you have experience in how that stuff is handled:

Second question is we usually do payments per milestone which is broken up by 10,000 word count of content. Historically it has taken our previous narrative designer about 8 hours of work per 10,000 word count of content. What do you think your price will be per 10,000 word count of content?

[Introduction | Naninovel](https://naninovel.com/guide/)

A full-featured, writer-friendly and completely customizable visual novel extension for Unity game engine.


answer: 

I haven't used naninovel before, but I am very familiar with the idea of Conditional statements and variables - (if statements, set variables...etc) - I can quickly familiarise myself with it. I am comfortable with basic level of coding ( excluding data structures ). I can jerry-rig codes to make them work for me and for anything I can't code myself - I can google and learn from there.

I would like to receive payment per milestone instead of per hour of work. My price for 10,000 words would be $160 dollars.

I had some questions -
How long will the deadlines on each milestone be?
How many milestones would you be asking for my services to start with?
How will you count the number of words delivered exactly?
Is there a place for growth?


----------

> What would the 20 hours of work entail exactly? Because if would you like me to work 20 hours every week? then my rate would be $ dollars per milestone ( 2 weeks of work ~ 10,000 words & Meetings & Naninovel Implementation ). Otherwise I would like to work on my own time besides the meetings.

Just to clarify, If I accept my first comission would be of 50,000 words ( 1 Episode ) divided by milestones of 10,000 words each? and each milestone would be stretch to two weeks?

Also, is the 20 hours per week contractualy binding? I would prefer to work on my own time other than the meetings, If that isn't a problem, that way I can deliver my best work for you.

Answer: 

Okay first, I like the dialogue, gave me a very comfy feel, haha.

Anyway, to asnwer your questions -

Answer 1: I Think I can do it comfortably, as far as I see it, It's not anything too complicated for me.  

For Clarification - I assume there is a certain style you maybe going for, to which I am not privy - Like - Where to fade? What background should it be? how should the character expressions and physical behaviours be (dissapointed, disbelief, arms behind back)? - Unless that's up for me to decided that, Which I would be more than happy to! but I would love a character description then ( so as to know what could be the best motifs for each moment )

I think there maybe be a beginning period, where I get used to the whole thing, but I am sure with right feedback I could easily proceed with what you would like more efficiently

Answer 2: Though I can't say for sure, as It's something new, I think my estimates would remain the same.

But If you want, we could setup a smaller milestone just so that we can get to know the nitty gritties of the whole process and each other's quirks. 
I think it could be - 2000 words as the first milestone,
	1) for any feedback you may have for me. 
	2) for me to gauge time taken/figuring out any quirks of naninovel.
	3) for me to to integrate myself with your pipeline.
	4) and anything else I may miss out.

I am fine eitherway.

Questions -

Would I get a credit in the game as a narrative designer?
If NO ==> Any reason? If Nothing substantial ==> Could I get a credit as edito?No?==> anything else?

at what times will you have the meetings to discuss? or will it be over chat like this?

Q2 - Would I need to run the naninovel scripts on my own PC in unity or would you have me write dry scripts and just send those to you?

Q3 - Is celeste going to die?
