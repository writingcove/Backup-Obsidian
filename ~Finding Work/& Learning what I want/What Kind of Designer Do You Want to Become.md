Ranking what I want to do in the games industry

1. Enjoys building a wider story context and communicating that via characters, VO, and dialogue, while making sure the player is always aware of the game’s larger plotline? (Narrative Designer)

2. Enjoys working on a smaller team at a smaller studio, and occupying a little of _each_ of these roles — or some totally different skillsets not mentioned here? (Generalist Game Designer)

3. Enjoys both of the above things, but intermingled? (Content Designer)
	- Enjoys motivating the player with gameplay-based reasons to do what they’re doing at every turn (Quest Designer)
	- Enjoys figuring out where enemies will spawn, how they’ll attack the player, and what items the player has at their disposal to take enemies down (Encounter Designer)
