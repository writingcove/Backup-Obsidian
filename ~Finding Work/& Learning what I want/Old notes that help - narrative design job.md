#A game designer on a subreddit said they would like to see these things when they look for a narrative designer:

	- Portfolio: games, mods, twine, stories, design ability, fit for company

	- Personality: if they find me interesting, match the culture of the company.


#another hiring manager:

	- " I look for people that have focused on branching narratives, divergent plots that are able to tell two, or three, or five equally interesting stories and land in a similar location across differing paths without risking blowing out game scope. "

	- Work: Plot, quest trees, dialogue, barks, characters, World overview documentation, relationship matice, flavour text, marketing copy, lore, editing, character arcs

	- Extra stuff: cinematography, choreography, Improv, theatre.

	- Practice as a DM - a lot.

	- be ready to change what you wrote.
