-----------------------------------------------------------

Neville is standing outside his house on the street, waiting. A car stops in front of him and the driver comes out and opens the passenger door to let Neville in.

Gregory: Good morning Director.

Neville: Good morning Gregory. A very chilly morning.

Director: Hot tea?

Neville: No, thank you, none of that garbage you call tea for me. (smiling)

Gregory: (laughing) hah

Neville: Give me some news Gregory. Why has our dear Minister called for the summons? 

Gregory: (hands over a report) (sipping tea) There has been an incident. About 5 hours ago, there was an explosion at Lakewood station and quite a big one at that. In approx a 100+ men have died, both workers and security.

Neville: A sad day I am sure, but that still doesn't answer why I had to be awoken in the middle of a very cold night. 

Gregory: There were two survivors, they reported seeing suspicious men entering the station before they left for their work. 

Neville: and?

Gregory: They say that those men were-

Neville: Bloody blazes! It's even colder in the car. I change my mind, I'll have some of that tea.

(Gregory pours Neville some tea)

Gregory: As I was saying, The survivors reported seeing Ishtari men.

Neville: (Sipping) Ishtari, hun? that's news, haven't heard of them since the purge, ... I assume that's our agenda for this summons, a bunch of religious dots setting explosives to sabotage the "great dream". The PC must be savouring at this development.

Gregory: More than savouring, There is more to the play here.

Gregory: ( Hands over another report ) There was an open communique 72 hours ago from an Ishtari post near City 7. Most of its religious diatribe, but if you read the last part-

Neville: (reading out loud) "In god we trust, death only is an instrument to him, be brave in the face of it, be brave when you ignite the flames your last rites". 

(looks at Gregory)

Gregory: The PC's Casus Beli.

Neville: The madman will finally get his war. How credible is the Ishtari story here? what do we know of this explosion?

Gregory: The last recovery team reported damage consistent with explosive charges, though you could chalk that up to a clearing explosives accident, I doubt it, the amount each work team gets is very carefully monitored. It's hard to say for sure, but in my professional opinion, I suspect foul play. Whether it's an Ishtari attack or something else is up for debate.

Neville: What about the revolutionaries? 

Gregory: Possible but highly unlikely, ever since we put Elliot grey in a grave, they seem to have dissipated into non-existence. 

Neville: We are about to join them. Gregory, check with border records, if this is indeed an Ishtari attack, they could have come along with the folk caravan that arrived yesterday from city 7. And put some watchers around any sympathizers or the remnants of the purge. 

(Gregory nods)

Neville: Who all are privy to this information?

Gregory: Us and everyone, the communique was an open one. It's just a matter of putting one and one together.

Neville: Set the IA to alert red, and take the survivors into protective custody, we can't be letting any more voices back the PC. 

(Gregory nods)

Neville: (Shouts to the driver) Ricket! How far are we off to the minister's office?

Driver: about 20 minutes sir.

Neville: Make it 10 and I will make sure your kids go to school.

Driver: Yes, SIR!

Neville: ( looks at Gregory ) I will not be dragged into another one of these farcical wars.

Neville enters a small conference room. The minister and the other senior summons members are seated along the gigantic centre table, others are standing around. Neville takes his seat at the table across from the minister.

Police Inspector - Edison:...Two men , they were spotted coming into station 7 at about 9:00 pm, two hours from the blast. (looks at Neville)

Neville:(takes seat) Please, continue.

Edison:...The workers who saw them say that they were...  Ishtari.

( whispers in the room )

Railway Head - Faulkner: Ishtaris?! are you blathering?

Edison: No sir.

Minister:  Edison, How sure are you of these men's veracity? 

Edison: They are bunker boys, sir, young-blooded sure, but they are proud nationalists, I could see no reason as to why they would lie about this.

(palm on his face)
Minister: What about others, have you found any others?

Edison: No sir, the night storm has been very difficult, temperatures have dropped into the negatives, to continue would mean more deaths.  For now, It's just those two. We will send out search parties come morning for any others if they aren't already lost to the storm. 

(silence in the room)

Political Commissar(PC) - Hiram: Barbarians.

(everyone looks at the pc)

Hiram: Most vile of all the men, they charr the dead and hang them up as offerings to their false gods. It's not unfathomable they would see our civilization grazed to the ground. We must act first.

Minister: Act first?

Hiram: A pre-emptive attack, so to say, it's is exactly what we need, our 5 cities combined have more soldiers than they can muster.  I suggest we report our findings to the chancellory and inform them of this grievous attack. Before it's too late.

Minister: Are you out of your mind Hiram?

Hiram: (confused) sorry?

Minister: How many years has it been since I've taken office?

Hiram: One...

(silence)

Minister: One Year and 10 days to date, that's the time I have served as the Regional head of our city. Do you know what will happen if we were to tell the chancellory of this attack if it is one? What will happen if I told them, that I who swore allegiance to protect this city failed to not only do that but also failed the GREAT DREAM?

Hiram: They will surely understand, it's a matter of national security and integrity of our ideal.

(Minister chuckles)

Minister: Understand? You confuse me, Hiram, you are a political commissar and yet you are oblivious to how things work or history. The moment we tell the chancellory of our failure to prevent any such attack or even the fact that the precious GREAT DREAM has been again delayed, they will mark not only us but our families for deaths ... or ...worse.

Hiram: You misjudge my intentions minister, my job is to make sure this nation survives and thrives, and I only care what's best-

Minister: They don't care for your ideals as much as they do for purported failure. I would take my chances with the dogged Ishtaris before I do it with the chancellory. 

Hiram: But If I were to deliver the message to the commissary in the capital, they wouldn't misunderstand-

Minister: There will be no buts here, I don't give a damn about what the Commissary has in plans. Let it be made clear to you and the rest of everyone who stands here. I am here to solely make sure that all of us live long and healthy lives, especially me, so If the word about this event were to get out to the chancellory without my permission, I will make sure that when the guns come for us, they wouldn't be able to find a body of yours to shoot. I hope I have made my intentions very clear.

Hiram: I do apologize, but I do understand the gravity of the situation, minister. We do have other options... We only need open the "doors" to them.

FRSB, Director - Neville: Minister!

Minister: summons members to stay, the rest of you can leave.

(people leave the room)

Neville: What the fuck are you doing Hiram? The knowledge of the vaults is strictly confidential and not to be spoken willy-nilly outside of the summon's confidence.

Hiram: The Ishtaris present us a great threat to our civilization. Their religion is like a fever, it takes hold and doesn't let go until the body is rid of its elements. There is a reason for the chancellory to have ordered the purges all those years ago. And if their minds have changed, It's time we remind them and open those doors, minister. The vaults is our only advantage.

Neville: Those doors are guarded by dogs, vicious ones. If we aren't careful, we may have consequences far beyond our control. Yet still, I see no reason as to why we would in the first place. There is no need for it.

Hiram: (( hands over communique & reports to the minister) This is our evidence against the Ishtaris. It's an open broadcast communique, proof of their intention. We have doors to open and to get any advantage we can, so I suggest we do.

Neville: That communique is ambiguous at best, their prudent dogma runs circles every so week. That's not proof. 

Hiram: Maybe it isn't, but are we to wait and see? 

Neville: A war isn't in our best interest, that too with unproven methods. We were lucky with our finds in those first vaults, we have no idea what could be in others.

Hiram: It could be boundless technology.

Neville: It could be disease.

Hiram: It could be grandiose resources.

Neville: It could be anything, we don't know! I suggest we keep our heads together and calmly try to solve the matter in a way that would please the chancellory as well as prove effective. We aren't in a position to gamble.

Hiram: It's too late for that, the bombing has made the GREAT DREAM untenable within the deadline, and if what the minister says is true then the chancellory will have our heads on sticks regardless of any result. Minister, open your eyes to the future, the structural bonds that hold our great nation together are only as strong as the leaders, if the current ones don't hold through the ideals then it isn't right, something must change. It's not right to have to worry about extrajudicial hangings or firing squads for every decision we take.

Neville: You are speaking of treason.

Minister: Are you suggesting we go against the chancellory? 

Hiram:  I am suggesting we keep every advantage we have, if that means we have to go past the chancellory to take action and save our nation, I don't see that as just a solution but a win. I would much rather have the advantage than not when the worst comes.

Neville: I would highly advise against any such action, minister, The advantages may be meek at best, We do not know what's in there, It will not only take time but money and men and even if we do find something, It would be difficult to keep it under wraps. I am not saying we shouldn't, but to delay it as planned, put it aside another such time as after the completion of the GREAT DREAM.

Hiram: ( laughing ) You are so blinded by your fear, that you see nothing other than your own way out. 

FSRB, Director - Neville: ( stands up) ( shouts ) A 100 good men have died today! a 100 who worked out there, in the freezing cold, day and night, all to make sure that our goals come to fruition. We do not mourn them, we do not stand in prayer for them, we only sit here in our warm offices, drinking tea, discussing war, deciding fates, for many more to die. I speak of the disingenuity of your cause Commissar. You say you want to protect our nation, yet you sit here asking for its demise with a brutal war with unproven methodology. Your credentials as the people's commissar are only in name, otherwise, you further your own agenda at the people's expense.

Political Commissar(PC) - Hiram: Please save your theatrics for someone who can't see through your guise, Neville. 

Minister: Enough! I will not have you two wording off, wasting my time. 

Minister: Sit down, let's look at our options - what are we to do if we are truly under an attack? why would the witness lie? Explosions don't happen themselves?

Neville: The ambiguity around this matter is severe, I would haphazardly trust a drunken beggar before I would any man working out there in the freezing tundra. I've been out there during the storm, It gets very cold out there, the state of mind of men is very different there than that of one here. As the cold get's rougher, It gets hard to breathe, so much so that the brain is deprived of oxygen, enough to make men see things, things they want to see. I only suspect foul play from the environment, the rapid cooling and thawing have egregious effects on man-made things. It could also very well have been an accidental detonation of the explosives the construction crew carry, isn't that right Mr Faulkner?

Faulkner: It could be.

Neville: However, It is true there is cause for caution, I suggest we open an investigation meanwhile doubling security and then move on, and as for the Chancellory, there are other options where we don't need to resort to unproven means or treason... 

Minister: which are?

Neville: The next national congress isn't far, I have words in my ears that there may be a change in the leadership. We can do our best to push for that and then it's only a matter of months to keep this all under wraps.

Railway Head - Faulkner: He is right, It would be best to put this all under a rug and forget about it. If the knowledge of this bombing were to spread, Everything would stop. The lower cities would stop cooperating, and that would be the end of the GREAT DREAM and cut off our access to the oil fields. I suggest we take Neville's advice and double the security, and start drafting men to finish the project.

Minister: Okay, then that's what we will do. But I want all options open, Hiram you will take charge of the dig site and continue the research, but do not open anything.

Hiram: Yes minister.

Minister: Now get out, all of you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Neville gets into the car waiting for him outside the minister's dacha.

Gregory: Doesn't look like things went all too well considering the shouting.

Neville: Better than expected, but not enough, get me a back channel to the chancellory will you Gregory.
