Hi PlayMe studio Devs, My name is Ram, I am a writer/narrative designer. I love to tell stories through our unique medium of games and I can see that you do too.

I currently work with an indie group trying to craft a vibrant game called: Four Moons - Tales of Occi -https://twitter.com/FourMoonsTM. Here, I help to create the world, history, characters, story, game design elements and more. And as a working professional, I have also had 2 years of experience in working in a tangential field of creating and strategizing content for the educational industry where I learned storytelling with complex concepts, understanding user behaviour and experience, professionalism, working with others, organizational skills and more.

Your game has a very keen uniqueness to it, It's trying to emulate the Dating App Model but with Fictional Characters, I can see the appeal of it. Also does getting rejected a lot on dating apps count as experience here? haha.
But on a serious note, I adore the idea, It allows writers to come up with a lot of interesting characters and storylines to go with them, It's definitely something I want to help you guys make and learn better narrative development along the way.
