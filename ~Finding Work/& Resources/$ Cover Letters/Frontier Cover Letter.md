Hi there Frontier team! It's lovely to be able to apply for this role. My name is Ram, I am a writer with 2 years of experience in creating instructional content. I am an avid gamer and writer of stories but professionally I make courses within the IT field. So applying for this role would be an opportunity for me to shift to an industry that is more oriented towards gaming. 

I have worked as a content strategist for two Very Large E-learning companies in India  (Great Learning & Intellipaat) over the last two years. There I was responsible for delivering content and courses through careful Planning, research, prototyping, creating storylines, scripting, and more. The two main things I would cite that I developed were  - telling stories with complex concepts and understanding user behaviour within such context. As such I always aim to write and create content with the user/student in mind first, hence creating intuitively designed content that is easy to navigate through and easy to understand, while also making it fun. Because of this, I think I would make a great Junior Technical Game Writer. Though I lack the experience I make it up with my passion for learning and creating.

I hold a bachelor's in Computer Science which gives me insight into things with a technical lens and helps me communicate and understand ideas with technical teams better.

On the side, I  volunteer with an indie group trying to make a 3rd person game called: Four Moons - Tales of Occi. Where I help to create the world, history, characters, story, game design elements and more. 

If I am not fit for the role or if you find someone better I would really appreciate any feedback to help me improve.
