Dear whoever so this concerns,

My name is Ramendra, you can call me Ram. I am aspiring narrative designer and writer. I know you stated you are looking for someone with experience, but let me state how I am and can handle such a position without havinf the experience. 

Creative & Aesthetic zeal is my motto, I love to tell stories that are inspired, a product of the need to tell rather than sell. I craft worlds, imagine lore, write interesting dialogue, introduce complex narrative structures and tell nuanced philosopohical thoughtview and ideologies from different perspectives - all to entertain the crowd. While making sure to maintain efficient design in order to maximize the player experience. 

Working in the E-Learning field in the past I have experience getting a direct feedback and incorporating it to tell an intuitive and innovative story.

I love to tell stories - Stories that get people lost in them. I try to craft worlds, write lore, write interesting dialogue, create complex narrative structures, and tell nuanced philosophical ideologies through different perspectives - all of it for one purpose, which is to make people forget about their worries for a moment and dive into the worlds that I have created for them. 

I am a budding writer, who loves to tell a good story and read one as well. I have had years of unofficial writing experience, be it - poems, short stories, excerpts, or just writing down my plain feelings. It's something that I can say I really like doing. 

As a professional I have also had 2 years of experience in working in a tangential field of creating and delivering content for the educational industry audience There I learned storytelling with complex concepts, understanding the user behaviour and experience, professionalism, working with others, organizational skills and more. It was a good experience for my life and career, but it's not my main goal.

In addition to my professional experience, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. It gives me an insight into things with a technical lens and helps me communicate and understand ideas with technical teams on a level that would be otherwise difficult.

Thank you for your time and consideration, I hope to either work with you or work beside you one day.

Sincerely,

Ramendra Tripathi
