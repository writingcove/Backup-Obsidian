Dear whoever so this concerns,

My name is Ram. I am an aspiring narrative designer and writer with prior experience as a Content Strategist. Creative & Aesthetic zeal is my motto, I love to tell stories that are inspired, and born out of a need to tell. I craft worlds, imagine histories, write compelling characters, introduce complex ludonarrative structures, and tell nuanced philosophical thought views and ideologies from different perspectives - all to entertain the crowd, all while keeping an efficient design to maximize the player experience. 

I have current experience working with an indie group trying to craft a vibrant game called: Four Moons - Tales of Occi. Where I help to create the world, history, characters, story, game design elements and more. I also am currently working on my own narrative-focused game using twine. I have familiarity with Python and C++ as I completed a Bachelor in Computer Science as my higher education which also gives me an insight into things with a technical lens and helps me communicate and understand ideas with technical teams on a level that would be otherwise difficult.

As a working professional, I have also had 2 years of experience in working in a tangential field of creating and strategizing content for the educational industry where I learned storytelling with complex concepts, understanding the user behaviour and experience, professionalism, working with others, organizational skills and more.

I know VR is a difficult beast altogether and requires a lot more understanding and experience, so I am sure it's doubly a challenge for you all. I only hope I can somehow make that experience fun while also learning something myself.

Thank you for your time and consideration, I hope to either work with you or work beside you one day.

Sincerely,
Ramendra Tripathi
