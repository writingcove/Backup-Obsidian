My name is Ramendra Tripathi, you can call me Ram for short. If it weren't already clear, I love to tell stories and games, So I craft worlds, imagine histories, write compelling characters, introduce complex ludonarrative structures, and tell nuanced philosophical thought views from different perspectives, all - to tell a story worth telling, and also to help make companies make money, otherwise, they would have to lay everyone off.

I have current experience working with an indie group trying to craft a vibrant game called: Four Moons - Tales of Occi. Here, I help to create the world, history, characters, story, game design elements and more. I also am currently working on my own narrative-focused game using twine. I have a bachelors in Computer Science engineering, this gives me insight into game development with a technical lens. I have "ctrl C and ctrl V, from StackExchange" kind of familiarity with Python and C++. I also have prior experience using GAMEMAKER Engine and it's propietory scripting language.

As a working professional, I have also had 2 years of experience working in a tangential field of creating and strategizing content for the educational industry where I learned the art of storytelling with complex concepts, understanding the user behaviour, experience, and other skills such as professionalism, working with others, organizational skills and more.

Games that inspire me - Freelancer, Metro 2033, Half life, Spec ops the line, Nigth in the Woods, Hyper light drifter, Dawn of war,  and more. other stuff i like - dune, blade runner, apocalypse now, grand Budapest hotel, the expanse.

I am a scifi nerd that loves geopolitics, history, a good negotiable salary, reading, cooking and giving lots of love to my dog. Also, I can speak elementary french. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, I wish to work with you or beside you one day :).
