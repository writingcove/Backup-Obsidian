Dogs, but it's debatable, there are basically two schools of thou-

My name is Ramendra Tripathi, you can call me Ram for short. If it weren't already clear, I love to tell stories and games, So I craft worlds, imagine histories, write compelling characters, introduce complex ludonarrative structures, and tell nuanced philosophical thought views from different perspectives, all - to tell a story worth telling, and also to help make companies make money, otherwise, they would have to lay everyone off.

I have prior experience in storytelling through my experience in the E-learning field. Besides this, I also help to create the world and story of "Four Moons - Tales of Occi " - an indie game project.

I have a bachelors in Computer Science engineering, this gives me insight into game development with a technical lens. I have "ctrl C and ctrl V, from StackExchange" kind of familiarity with Python and C++. I also have prior experience using GAMEMAKER Engine.

Games that inspire me - Freelancer, Metro 2033, superman 64, Half life, Spec ops the line, Nigth in the Woods, shaq fu, Hyper light drifter, Dawn of war,  and more. other stuff i like - dune, blade runner, apocalypse now, grand Budapest hotel, the expanse.

I am a scifi nerd that loves geopolitics, history, relocating for a new job, a good negotiable salary, reading, cooking and giving lots of love to my dog. Also, I can speak elementary french. 

Thank you for your time and consideration, your game looks dope, I really hope you'll do well.
