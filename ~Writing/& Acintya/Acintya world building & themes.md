Themes to explore -
	- Should we save lives at all cost? should we prioritise humans before anything else? Can the ideals of indivisualism ( i don't want to die for someone else ) mix well with selflessness?
	- Theme of how conspiracies can be more comforting because they imply that someone is in control of the world and everything will be okay - But reality is wild, we have shit in control and nobody is certain about the future. The world is chaos and we need to embrace the chaos.
	- Theme of more than just surviving, needing to feel and explore what the world has to offer instead of just going with the flow. Embracing the chaosm, sort of.
	- being a civilised person is a very subjective view, try to show the hidden form of racism and colonial mindset through christopher - but make it very subtle.
	- a sense of solidarity is what a lot of us are looking for, that's why cults can be so alluring for some people - especially if you are very lonely.
