Let's explore the trolley question, do the lives of few matter more than the lives of many. We need to explore how christopher will answer this question - Will he chose the death of one over many or will he chose the death of many over one. Now this is something I am chosing for the character while in his shoes - How will it change when the character is the player itself!

What is the aim of a narrative driven game? It's a game so it implies there is player choice and since there is choice it implies that there can be different narratives depeding upon the choices taken by the player. The point of a game is to provide enterntainment to the player while delivering a powerful message as is with the case of narrative driven games, and in most driven games the enterntainment value comes from the narrative itself. This means that each choice must be organically structured to provide the player with enjoyment. To organicaly structure each narrative I must think the outcome for each narrative separately which means I have to think how each narrative will take place. My aim with the game will be to deliver a powerful message that also has entertainment value to the player. 


Trolley problem has many solutions depending upon the situation - but it ahs been done may times before - a lot well in other places that you may not even know about - So for now let's just aim to be better than ourselves and even just try to entertain ourselves.
