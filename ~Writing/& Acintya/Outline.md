Christopher is tasked with the mission of finding the lost franlkin party beyond the village. So first he travels to the remote village. He does not travel alone, he has two partners.

after talking to some villagers and taking some rest christopher takes the backroad onto the dead wasteland to find the franklin party.

Unsuccesful the first day, he with his subordinates returns to the village finding things have become somewhat weirder. There are more and more drunk people on the street, the UN Guarding force has disappeared ( there were about 5 men - all are nowhere to be seen ) - christopher assumes they just left.

Again after gathering more information and getting more idea abot who the franklin party was from the village party office archive - he heads off again into the great wasteland inhope of finding what he was looking for. And accidently two of the those who were with him helping him look for the franklin party die off a on a cliff. 

he returns to the village alone, no one pays mind that his subordinates are missing. in shock he only gives a glancing thought to the idea but then starts to question whether he shoud go back or keep moving forward to complete the mission. His obsession takes the better of him and he decides to continue the mission.
