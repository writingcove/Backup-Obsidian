**Origins of Religion of Vigour**
	- Strength and Courage are the core pillars of this Hemeian Society, the hemeians hold these two values over everything else even if it may not be right from our perspective. Every aspect of their daily life revolves around these pillars and we will explore how so. strength - body, courage - mind, honour - soul. Hunting, raiding, war, atheletic events, 
	
	athletic event to honour their moon god.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	***Let's start of by discussing how the religion came to be:-***
	- Long ago,  The primordial entity and the goddess of creation - Ar'thra decided to create the Planetary body of Zilea and to light up her creation she decided to create three luminous moons - Of which one was the Moon of Vigour ( It wasn't called so at the time and only when the hemeins came to be they named it so ). The moon has reddish glow with which it illuminates the dark skies of Zilea along with the others.
	**CONTEXTUAL NOTE - 
	- The goddess ar'thra is an elusive creator that doesn't really wished to be worshipped and resigns to stay on the sidelines while watching her little world play out and  hence never revealed herself as the creator to the majority of her creations on Zilea ( But she did show herself to some, we will talk about that later)**
	- So when Akeans and Sanoans first arose out of the shards of the moon of life they were left to their own to devises to discover the world of Zilea. But soon they each realised the mystical abilities of the lights of the moons, each race of being decided to set their eyes upon one of the moons but also respected and codefied other moons in their religions and culture. 
	- After many thousand moon laps and the collapse of the sanoan civilisation, another civilsation grew out of the ashes of sanoa - The hemeians. The hemeians are decendants of the ancient sanoans.
	- As they grew their civilisation they quickly adopted the moons into their own religion, one that's inspired from the sanoans but has it's very own unique touches.
	
	
**History of Path of vigour religion**
	- The path of vigour has had many different forms and practices that were followed by many different peoples. The sanoan civilisation were the ones to start the worship but once sanoa fell due the great calamity the hemeins emerged among the ashes and followed the religion but with their own touch as it had happened with the (greeks and mycenian greeks and minoans in real life)
	- The fall of sanoa had a devastating effect on a lot of people, even the akeans due to the calamity ( which we will discuss later), this caused the start of the dark ages when there were little records what happened, but after a few years some smaller kingdoms rose. The records are better for this period but
	- In the past 1000 years the path of vigour has had many heads of the religion and sometimes even the emperor of hemei would hold the title. but in the current time, the roles are separated.
	- Many wars have been fought in the past during warring period when the hemeins were under different warlords and had different acharyas ( religious heads ) with different ideologies
	- During the start the great hemeain period when all of hemeia was united under the rule of the {...}'s dynasty the religion was also consolidated and become one under one High acharya.

**Religious system**
	- Religion plays a big role within the empire of hemeia, thought the king/emperor rules from his seat in Honningvale ( the floating castle ), he only has supreme rule over the administration of the country, foreign policy. A lot of power resides within the clergy of the path of vigour which is headed by the High Acharya/Rajrishi/Rinpoche ( basically a high priest ). He is elected by an inner circle of high rishis/acharyas that have their own holdings and influence divided within the realms of hemeia. The high acharya and his inner circle hold judicial power in hemeia, any ruling that needs to be given is given by them or their fellow subordinates as delegated. Though formally the acharya's swear loyalty to the king they can do as they please within the constraints of their organisation. Anyone can rise up to become a high acharya.
	- The emperor of hemeia is regarded as the guardian of the religion and the hemeain folk, since they had to face many difficulties during the dark ages they have come out as very protective and fierce people who generally dislike those who aren't hemeians.
	
	
**Beliefs**
	- Strength and Courage
	- The hemeins are proud stubborn people. For them these two core have brought them out of the dark times ( after the fall of sanoa and the period of warring states ) and hence they value strength and courage over anything else. 
	- Farmers usually celebrate a the festival of harvest during 9th full moon of the year and with this they conlude a year in the hemein calendar.
