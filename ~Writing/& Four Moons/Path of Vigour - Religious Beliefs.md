## What Is the Belief?
**Explanations for existence**
		- Hemeians believe the world came into existence when ah'thra created Zilea and the hemeian's ancestors the Sanoans. 
		- Though the creator, Ah'thra is not regarded same as she would be in the real life religions, she is more like the Bhrama rather than god father.
		- The hemeians belive in their code of living rather than the god itself.
		- Ethos - to live life according to the right rules as such written down.
		- Hemeians and the believers of the path of vigor believe that they were put on the planet of Zilea to follow a strict code of piety as written in the book of vigor{yet to be named}. The book states how one should live their life as in accordance to the three pillars - Strength, Honor and Courage. 
		- according to the believers, life is cyclical, which means that they are born again and again until they can break free through the chain to move onto another plane of existence. 
		- Death is bittersweet, It's painful knowing the journey of the one you loved has to come an end with you, but its beautiful because it can mean one has gotten the chance to go the other plane of existence or has gotten another chance to break free through the cycle. Animal sacrifice is made to help the better passing of the loved one.

**Powerful beings:**
		- There are many myths that talk about legendary character that were put on ZIlea to guide the people and give them an example of how to live life. Example: {hercules like legend}
		- There is the guadian of the path of vigor, the guardian is a strong, fierce yet honorable being that guards one of the few artifacts.
		- {Purpose of the artifacts, yet to be determined} suggestion - some kind of weapons?
		- {Discuss the guardian with alex}

	include spirits, or great beasts. 
	
**Ethical standards**:
		The religion plays great significance to the GREAT HUNT. a mythological hunt that involved their godess of creation Ah'thra as the lead huntress who would ride down from the ether in her chariot and take part in the great hunt with the ancestors of the hemeians. or atleast that's how the myth goes. 
		So hemeians live and sruvive for the greatest hunt of their lives. or at least that how they are supposed to and used to. However, over years and time this hunt has become more and more an elusory concept that has formed the fundamental basis for a philosophical system that governs how the current hemeians live, work and lead their lives. Basically there are a set of guidelines that inform people on how they should be making decisions.
		These guidelines are written one singular text that was created by a legendary figure for hemeians.{discuss with alex}
- VIRTUES {*Ideal expectation}* - 	- 
			- STRENGTH {body|mind|spirit} - Strength is the first tenet of the path of vigor, as with a hunt, men, women are equally called upon to show strenght and hunt strong beasts. Strenght is often embodied through physical or spiritual prowess and those who show these attributes are regarded higher in stature than those who don't. Strength is a highly valued attribute, as it means the survival of the fittest. Strength is more akin to fieriocity and raw power rather than smarts(even for spiritual powers). 
			- COURAGE {body|mind|spirit} - Courage is the second tenet of path of vigor, as with a hunt, men, women are equally called upon to show courage even in the face of the most dangerous situations. Courage is often embodied by men and women being fearless when heading into war and risky situation where life and death are in question. Though this is meant to show that people can prevail even in the darkest of the situations if they are brave enough. In reality what usually ends up happening is that people take very risky decisions and unnecessarily put others life as well as theirs into peril. 
			- These two tenets though meant to have positive effects, generally tend to have an opposite effect as people fail to understand nuances of the tenets and only embody the surface level meaning, leading to instability and violence.
			- HONOR {body|mind|spirit} - Honor is the third tenet of the religion. But it is often overshadowed by the other two tenets. There are few who acurately are able to embody this by 
		- GENDER ROLES {*ideal expectation*}:- Though the society is a patriarcal one, the gender role expectations are unconventional. Men are supposed to embody physical strenght {as the hercules analogue legend does} and women are supposed to emoby spiritual strenght{analogoue to another legend}. Which means that women often play top dog roles such as high priestess, wizards and shard mechanincs & alchemists. Since spiritual energy is important in relation to handling of the shards, women are often better at handling of the shards than men and are hence awarded the position of wizards in most places where one is required. 
			- {Reality} - As with anything in real life, things are grey and often intermixed. Withing large cities the above holds true but within villages and smaller towns where the interpretation of the path of vigor deviates, women can often be relegated to lower roles even though they may have higher prowess when it comes to handling shards and alikes. Though some women still are the regarded high priestess even there. But generally the attitude is that women aren't as useful as men. But this is also becuase of the lack of need for shard users in villages and small areas.







**Rituals:**
	Many religions are intertwined closely with lifestyles, and have special ceremonies for important life moments – such as weddings, funerals, or coming of age. However, rituals could also be designed to curry favor from the gods, protect from evil spirits, or to seek information from the divine.
	-Hunting - Hunting is seen as one of the most divine rituals that everyone must partake in, men and women included {Though their parts in the hunt vary}. The hunt is seen as a very religious rite that embodies all three tenets of the religion of path of vigor, all in one. Strength enough to slay beasts, courage enough to face beasts, honor enough to help your fellow people and having and understanding to make sure that the beasts aren't over hunted.	Since hunting always formed one of the most important event of the life of a hemeian, they view hunting as one of the most valuable skill to have and this is universal idea among most of those who follow path of vigor. Courage plays a big role here as the ability to face larger and more dangerous animals shows that you have more than normal courage.
		- {Reality} - Though hunting is seen as one of the most important ritual, only those with enough money and time can go on a hunt for large beasts. Most poor people have to contend in hunting smaller beasts that do not require a lot of effort, time or money. Hunts are usually done only as a religious practice in the current time, even though it's written in the holy scripture that it's the only way to eat. but with a very large population it is difficult to feed everyone with just meat and have to farm large amounts of fields to feed everyone. So people follow a loop hole whereby they do a cermonial hunt before each meal to apease the laws and then eat meal that comes from farms(also because of beer 
 becuase who doesn't love beer). Nobody really bats an eye on this law as everyone understands. but obviously there are a few nutters who are strict adherents of the rule and will see others who don't follow the rules are blashphemers. This was a huge problem with the stricter side of the clergy but when honnongvile the uniter created the unified clergy, this rule was designified.
### What’s the reason for it?
Belief systems arise from the circumstances people find themselves in, so they generally include guidelines that
**Justify existing social systems**
	If this is the dominant religion in a culture with a strong hierarchy, it will offer reasons for why some people have more power than others. The king was chosen by the gods, or the lowest caste is descended from traitors.
**Encourage health and survival:** 
	Many religions include rules that are just plain old good ideas – or were at one time. It may forbid people from drinking from a specific lake, because its water makes people sick. Even if they later learn how to make the water safe, it could remain taboo.
**Reinforce the belief system itself:** 
	If the belief system has survived for a while, it almost certainly has components to help keep people from straying. It will promise some kind of reward to devoted followers – enlightenment, special powers, life after death – and punishment for those who undermine it or join a competing belief system. Sometimes the rewards and punishments are merely social – acceptance or rejection by other followers.



Day-to-Day Life

A ritual dance that became a relaxation event. 

Festivals - 
--
Dances, music, beer equivalent, dressing up as beast - pretend hunts, retelling of mythological stories for kids, acting troops, Aztec hoop games, 
Festivals are events to celebrate events - harvest festivals, changing of the seasons
<<<Founding of the Kingdom!>>> It's very big deal because founding brings peace and cetrainity and so did the last founding. 


Artstyle & fashion -
--
The armour given to the king is a special gift from the giants, because they control the iron smelting business. Armours are very expensive as they are gifts from the giants. 
Heraldry - So we know the king has a heraldry - the eagle - clans. Guilds will have their own heraldry. 
Fashion - 



RoughNotes:
--

Generally speaking the religion of path of vigor has only one godess - Ah'thra - The godess of creation. But she isn't the main part of the religion, she plays the role of the creator but the Hemeians are more focused on the philosophy/religion of the path of vigor - The idea of the TRI pillars - Strength | Courage | Honor - corresponding to - Body | Mind | Spirit. 

You can call the path of vigor a Philosophy/Tradition/Religion/way of governing/way of life. There was once a teacher who guided the hemeains in the ways of life after the great calamity and from him many different schools of thought were born, which eventually turned into sects of the religion that we come to know today - like - Sect of Alacrity, or the Dragon Sect )


posit the creation of a third faction - the Civil authority/the state bureacracy
Basically the right hand of the king that helped in the ruling of the goverment. 



The clergy refer to themselves as the scholars - {word for scholars}.


The steel provided by the giants helped the king recruit untrained commoners into his army, allowing him greater power. but this had a blowout effect on a lot of the kingdom, it was formed on another weak foundation - taking the commoners into the army - left fields unattended, infrastructure weak and social discontnet among everyone, and food was scarce.

The way confuscious disliked rebellion as he was born during that era, our leader will also have rules that reflect when he was born - the era of calamity.

The three pillars of the religion have a much deeper meaning and cause. If a ruler fails to portray strenght/honor/courage he can be challenged so that one that does portray these values can take over.
