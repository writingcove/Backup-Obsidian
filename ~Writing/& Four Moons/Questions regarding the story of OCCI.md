{Stuff we need to start working on}

	the chosen one overarching story
	


{stuff I liked that was really cool}

	The lore about how hemians chained islands to the mountains with the help of giants. ancient ruin of the sanoan city upon which the hemein city is built.

Critique/ stuff that could be better -

	There is a sense of urgency missing. as in - there seems to be no tension for the plot to take place. character agency is also lacking.


	The Chosen one story line has been done so many times, It's not an issue that we are doing it again but It would be better if we were to put a unique spin to it - Like he was artificially created using some shards and hence he has trouble understanding all of the hemean(human) emotions and rules ( maybe this could be some type of neurodivergent representation also). He could have been created by ulthor himself ( as he is an ancient sanoan ) - we could later reveal it as a twist.

	The names can be unique to each type of race as with akeans they have a very special way of naming themselves that is different from the hemeans. ( like how in real life we have each name being unique to the culture.) THis way it's easier to distinguish each person by their name itself. detail to the world.

		akeans - Y'drn {no vowels in their names}

		hemeians - Osai, Occi, Macci, ( a simillar name range, )

		it could be even deeper with each faction having many multiple inner factions with their own types of name culture.

	1000 year alliance, is a bit unrealistic, let's change it to 100 years, the 1000 year alliance has implications that things have been going well for both hemeans and akeans for a pretty long time.

{Addition to Lore Ideas}

	The war that's happenning between akeians and hemeia is actually because of a background deal between the akeans and the hemein government head( without the knowledge of the king) . Ydrin sees the outcast akeans as low lifes and wants to get rid of it, but sacred beliefs would not allows for spilling of blood on purpose and all the akeans would deeply frown upon such a thing, so ydrin makes a deal with the hemeian prime minister/viceroy to start a war. This way ydrin gets what he wants and a war would make the king appear unpopular with the crowd and the viceroy could have him overthrown and suitable puppet installed.
	
	Another thread idea - ulthor asks occi not to follow the bandits and instead look for the necklace. This thread is a character arc start for ulthor that makes him more understanding of the woes of the normal hemeians, normally 
	
	
Since the 4th moon of life was broken up into multiple pieces and now that there are shards of it lying all around we could have VERY VERY large pieces as well as the small ones that do apear in the story. This is to give the feel of the grandiosity. THe large pieces are guarded by very large creatures that were given birth by those large pieces. So anyone with enough intelligence could start using these crystals to mold life and even create life. - lot of possibilities here.
