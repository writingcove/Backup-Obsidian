Who is Neville

Neille is the head of the FSRB which is used to be a military intelligence branch of City Militia Force. But during the white purge a lot of Ishtari people were eliminated and killed or sent to labor camps. Neville was thrust the leadership of the military seeing that he has previously been a part of the army that led the nation to a war and was one of the only ones with an actual background in handling military matters.

Though Neville also saw this as a necessary step for his career and grabbed at the opportunity, strengthing and consolidating power more than ever before. 

The FSRB is completely new, It used to be a part of previous military but now has become it's own military and all the previous officers and cadets have also transferred over. The responsibility of military intelligence now falls to a newly created department within the FSRB called Internal affairs.

There has been a powershift very quickly and it has changed teh dynamics of the city politics.

So the City that this story takes place in, is just a smaller parts of the 5 city large nation with the Politburo at it's center. The nation was formed through conquest of the cities by this new governing party, which has banned all previous parties. When our story takes place the city is under the rule of this party. Neville, Rockwell, Hiram are all party members thought Neville has no official roles within the party, is only a card carrrying member and is so by mandate.

The city went through turbulent times when the white purge took away it's heads of the governing body and the Politburo had to rush to install other heads as even the vices and deputies and secondories were also often purged.

So in our story rockwell is one of the higher ranking members from the party from the main city sent by the politburo to run the city. He owes much to some of his connections and was able to get this position through promise of a great delivery. The project of Great Dream was started as a process of healing for the city and rebuilding of the economy which was in shambles.

So it's important the railway project go forward as there is a lot of money being poured into it.

Neville isn't one to brag, but he relishes in his new power. It has made him a bit overconfident and overcontrolling of every situation.

Gregor is second in command for Neville, no officially, but he has been with him since the early days of his position as FSRB head. Officially the position of second belongs to Langdon. A military officer from the previous military. He is one to follow oders and respects neville as vetern of the previous wars. But he is from the city and has some patriotic feelings, though he was born in the post party era.

Neville is old, about 60, but that's not very old. Also there is a distinction between military intelligence and internal affairsm the purges were conducted in the city by Comissary which also maintains it's own secret police contingent within the police that only report to them.

The effect of the purges has made him more protective of his own and has made him see a need for a greater consolidation of power in the city and maybe even the dimunition of the complete power.


-------------
Neville is standing outside his house on the street, shivering and waiting. A car stops infront of him and the driver comes out and opens the passenger door to let neville in.

Gregory: Good morning Director.

Neville: Good morning gregory. 

Director: You seem cold, hot tea?

Neville: No, thank you, none of that garbage for me, I would rather drink cold water straight from the pipes or eat my wife's cooking.(smiling)

Gregory: hah

Neville: Give me some news gregory. why has our good Minister has called the summons? 

Gregory: (hands over a report) There has been an incident. About 4 hours ago, there was an explosion at lakewoord station and quite a big one at that. In approx a 100+ men have died, both workers and security.

Neville: A sad day I am sure, but that still doesn't answer why I had to be awoken in the middle of a very cold night. 

Gregory: There were two survivors, they reported seeing suspicious men entering the station before they left for their work. 

Neville: and?

Gregory: They say that those men were Ishtari..

Neville: Bloody blazes! It's even colder in the car. I change my mind, I'll have some of that tea.

(Gregory gives tea to Neville.)

Neville: (Sipping) So, ishtari hun? that's news, Haven't heard of them since the purge. What's our angle here?

Gregory: There are only 2 ishtari families still living in the city, they are all highly educated doctors. I doubt they have anything to do with a railway project. But there is more to the play here.

Gregory: ( Hands over another report ) This is a comunique intercepted from an Ishtari post near City 5.

Neville: (reading out loud) "United we stand, United we prosper, death only is a instrument to god". 

Neville: bad grammer...

Gregory: hun?

Neville: It's the usual Religious Diatribe.

(Gregory point to the last sentence of the communique)

(contemplative silence) 

Neville: (looks at gregory) It's the Casus Beli... the one that our honorable PC has been looking for.

Neville: Who all have this information gregory?

Gregory: Everyone, it was an unencrypted message.



Neville: (Shouts to the driver) Ricket, How far are we off to the minister's office?

Driver: about 20 minutes sir.

Neville: Make it 10 and I will send your kids to that fancy school.

A busy room. Some are sitting along the table, others are standing. Neville and gregory enter the room as a conversation is going on.

Police Inspector - Edison: ..Two men were spotted coming into station 7 at about 9:00 pm, two hours from the blast. (looks at Neville and gregory)

Neville:(takes seat) Please, continue.

Police Inspector - Edison: ..The workers who saw them say that they were..  Ishtari.

Railway Head - Faulkner: (stands up) Ishtaris?!

( whispers in the room )

Police Inspector - Edison: (stutters) Yes, sir.

Minister: Edison, How sure are you of these men's veracity? Otherwise this a grevious allegation.

Police Inspector - Edison: They are bunker boys, sir, young-blooded sure, but they are proud nationalists, I could see no reason as to why they would lie about this.

(palm on his face)
Minister: What about others, have you found any others?

Police Inspector - Edison: No sir, The Investigation is still going on, minister. But the night storm has been difficult, temperatures have dropped too negetive 60 c, To continue would mean more deaths.  For now, It's just those two. We will send out searching parties for others come morning if they aren't already lost to the storm. 

(silence in the room)

Political Commissar(PC) - Hiram: Minister, It seems we are at the doors, We have been handed down our cause.









I believe It is now the time to let the chancellory know and rile the engines of our greater nation. 

Minister: For god's sakes, it's only been a month! I asked for one month! One Month! One month without anything going wrong!

Minister: Neville?

CPF, commander - Neville: I would advise against any action that would bring this into light, minister. Those doors are guarded by dogs, Vicious ones. We don't know the consequences of telling the chancellory, let alone anyone apart from this table, about the Vaults we found. 
Political Commissar - Jhon: There was an explosion! We have eyewitness testimony of terrorists. What more evidence do you need? There is a state floundering at any opportunity for weakness, We need to use every advantage we have and those vaults, below our city, have answers that may give us that very advantage.

CPF, commander - Neville: I would highly advise against such action, minister, The advantages of opening something that old maybe meek, It will not only take time but money and men and even if we may find something, It would be difficult to keep it under wraps, lest we let it fall in the wrong hands. I say we put aside another such time as after the completion of the GREAT DREAM Besides, It's not a surety that those men were Zatarskis, I would haphazardly trust a drunken beggar before I would any men working in the tundra. It gets very cold out there, I've been there during the storm, minister and I can tell you, that the state of mind of men is very different there than that of one sitting in a cozy office warmed by water. It gets hard to breathe you see, so much so that the brain is deprived of enough oxygen to make men see things, Things they want to see. And we can't let such ambiguity disturb the peace we have. I suggest that we double our security and move on, and besides, It's bad for business, won't you agree Mr Faulkner?

Railway Head - Faulkner: Quite. I agree, It would be best to put this all under a rug and forget about it. If the knowledge of this bombing were to spread, Everything would stop. The years of work we have put into diplomacy with the lower cities and access to the lucrative oil fields in the south, The GREAT DREAM. It would all be gone in an instant, Rockwell.
Political Commissar - Jhon: There are things at stake greater than filling your pockets. And what about the explosions? they just don't happen at random.

Minister: And what if what Jhon is saying is true? If it is a state-sponsored attack, we cannot defend miles and miles of railway tracks. and if worse, it's an all-out war, we are left only with your barebones force and the city police, which I garner isn't enough to stop an attack from the Zatarskis.

CPF, commander - Neville: The back channels keep me informed, minister, I don't suspect any foul play from the zatarskis, of any sort. Sure, we have our few insiders engaging in espionage and theirs in our city, but it's all much under control, minister. And even if we are hypothetically under an attack, I can assure you my men and the honourable marshal's men are enough for the city's protection. and as for the explosion - I suspect foul play from the environment, the rapid cooling and thawing have egregious effects on man-made things. It could also very well have been an accidental detonation of the explosives the construction crew carry, isn't that right Mr Faulkner?

Railway Head - Faulkner: Quite.

CPF, commander - Neville: I wouldn't worry you with it, minister.

Political Commissar - Jhon: Let's at least investigate it. 

CPF, commander - Neville: I am sure the Zatarskis are digging their tunnels beneath us as we speak.  (coy laughter around)

Political Commissar - Jhon: Minister, as the head of the political party in the city, I implore that before you pass any judgement, we have an in-depth inquiry into the bombing, I would request we set up a transparent enquiry committee to further investigate the situation. Perhaps we may get a third-party member from Riga.

CPF, commander - Neville: CPF can handle it in its entirety, I would advise against raising any more brows than necessary. I am sure the news of the explosion is already running circles. Fortunately, we can spin it off as an accident, it would still hurt but it's better than speculative anxiety. Besides, Accidents happen all too often, minister, people will forget.
Minister: For now that is good enough for me, I consider this matter as finished, you can take your leave. But Neville, I want to know what happened. 

CPF, commander - Neville: Yes minister.
