I like metro exodus a lot
the game had a vision
to put you into an open apocalyptic russia
the story comes to you very naturally
through - characters, environment, audio cues, remenants, background details, art, lighting and more
you are immersed in the world and experiencing it in a design.
That's the vision I am talking about - it doesn't need to be a complete story or idea at first but a vision you have that you want to make
That helps you decide what kind of game you want to make
Okay, sorry if this seems all to obvious
but it hit me like a brick when I was making my narrative game which was only going from text of walls to another.
I had a story that was complete
but it became difficult to fit a game around it, with gameplay
so that's all I could do
So this project i mentioned
I am on right now
It's about putting my vision to light
Which Is - I want the player to go into my world and not read it 
go into it and get lost
exploring it
it's like if indiana were to read the book about the temple of lost doom instead of going to it
While in know it is possible through reading
but WE ARE MAKING A GAME
