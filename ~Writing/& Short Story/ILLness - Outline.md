Part -1 
	It starts with the death of his father. It was a very surreal feeling of disbelief - a feeling you can only know if it has happened to you. He died from a terminal disease but his father sweared it wasn't the disease that was out to kill him but something in the shadows. {Allude to how the rare disease also causes hallucinations} {Create Paranoia about what really killed him}. The death wasn't abrupt and happened over a period of 3 years in which many drastic and weird things happened from weird events and family matters that became heightened. When his father was first diagnosed, everyone got checked to see if they had it or not. Even the MC. Talk about the last image he sees of his dad.

Some time passes
Part - 2
	We are caught up on how mc is doing. we start to sprinkle weird things. Mc shifted away to a new home, mc got a job, mc quit his job. Drop in a fact about a weird thing MC is concerned with about his skin. then later after a checkup it's nothing. everyone is relieved. There is a strange man he starts seeing on his daily walks with louietalk. He sees a person haging out on the streets he hasn't before and he sees that person everytime he takes louie out for a walk. Talk about body dismorphia and how uncomfortable he feels seeing people walking out on the street. Going on instagram and more. all of it makes him feel like shit. The toll of a very long break starts to show signs. talk about how he has difficulty dreaming something that's not dad. but starts to feel relieved when he stops seeing his dad in his dreams. he doesn't like to talk about his dad or even think about it. It makes him feel very weird and sad. add the paranoi on a bigger level as everyproblem he sees could be explained away as hypochindria.

Part - 3
	but some time passes and MC starts seeing a strange pattern on his neck apear. it apears some days and doesn't others. it's strange but the tension is high so he doesn't want to see a doctor about it. He would rather let it be and instead focus on trying to study for a new career.  talk about how the place where he lives has become sort of a prision for him because he hasn't left that place in a very long time due to covid lockdowns. So it starts to feel like an ethereal place from which he hasn't left in a very long time, like backrooms. The break starts to show weird signs. Then things start going very weird mc gets wierd symptoms that could be very easily explained away with real life logic, but he sees more dead/weird people with strange marks on their bodies.

Part - 4

	The weird monster that he sees are very different, in the later stages of his story MC starts seeing images of his dad again. and then he starts seeing people with weird mechanical alterations to their bodies like his dad.






I wish i could change my body, I feel like my body betrays me, I fell like my body is keeping me back

sometime I imagine myself to be a hunchbacked pig with ugly breath and smells. I feel trapped but not in a trans way, I think if i were a female in female body with simillar issues I would feel the same way, I just want a different body.

south park character - is your paranoia justified? it could be something you could toy the reader with

How did it start?
	When dad was discovered with cancer. I never thought something that I would see in media happen to us. 

	The barrier/shield was broken, no longer was I looking past things that I thought normal earlier. - more on this later

	The psychotic break. the feeling of being lost and trappend and scared, all alone. Friends kind of left me all alone. I had nothing but my own thoughts and a bearing down of academic stress.

	I came out stronger but weaker.

	Then I ignored his cals. Knowing he needed my help but I wasn't there for him, to help him.



living in gulashan ikebana started to feel like I am trapped. I don't feel trapped in small spaces as much as I do in theories of these big jails. Staying awake at night really did do a number on my mental health, It was as if I were transported to another weird place where I was forced to live everyday in the blackness of the night, not meeting or talking to people enough and trying desperately to get my career of the ground.
