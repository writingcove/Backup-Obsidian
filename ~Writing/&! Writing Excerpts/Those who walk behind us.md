**Prologue:** 

It was dead cold and dark in the room and she had a cap on her head. She never wore hats. The fact that she was wearing one right now would have been the most odd thing if she weren't in a silent and dark room tied completely naked to a chair by her hands  and her legs. She tried to feel for bruises and cuts on her body but she couldn't feel any except for a mild headache which she attributed to being drugged for a long time

Bright yellow light flicked on, blinding her, they were shining from what she could assume were the corners of the room.

"Hello Ms Fay" The silhouette of large bodied man entered into her peripheral, his voice very deep and smooth.

 she smiled and squinted to see her captor.

"If you were going to drug me , you could have at least offered me something to a drink . I am not a big fan of needles"

"Ah sorry about that Ms Fay, I am afraid we didn't have much time back then." He replied as he took a seat in front of her.

"Yeah well apology not accepted, I am not sure my Landlords will appreciate seeing track marks on my hand again" she retorted with a passive aggressive chuckle.

"Haha don't worry about that, Lets get to why you are here."

"Okay. Why am I here?"

"You were involved in a string of ..." he took a breath " aberrant Events"

There was silence, his words struck her like a spear through her heart, it was a dreading reminder of what had happened. she had some problem recollecting the events that happened earlier this week and had been questioning the dubious nature of their reality. She had tried to forget about it all together but she found constant reminders of what had happened everyday since. It were as if the thing was still there, watching and observing her, and constantly reminding her of the consequences. The kidnapping had been a relief, on waking up her first thoughts weren't about what had happened or her dismantling sanity. she was glad there was someone with her right now.

"uhh...i ....listen...Something or someone..." she hesitated and there was visible nervous shift in her tone. The man sitting in front of her understood this.

He leaned towards her"listen Fay... I understand that whatever happened to you must have been very traumatizing but I need you to tell me everything''

It wasn't just traumatising, it was egregiously maddening. Her train of thoughts had been muddled to a point where she only understood that she was as a person only pieces of neurons connected together.  She pulled herself together.

"Listen, I have tried to tell the everybody about this, the police, My family, My friends, but nobody believed me. and I don't think you whoever you are will believe me either "

He postured himself comfortably back into the chair"Ms Fay you wouldn't be here if we had even an ounce of doubt about what happened."
