**Marshal** : Edison, tell them

**Edison - police inspector** : Before the explosion happened, two men were spotted coming into station 2 at about 9:00 pm, About two hours before the blast. 

**Marshal** : Go ahead.

**Edison** : ..The railroad workers who saw them say that they were Zatarskis.

**Head of Railway Committee - Faulkner** : Zatarskis?!

**Edision** : Yes.

( silent whispers in the room )

**Minister** : Edison, How sure are you of these men's veracity?

**Edison** : They are bunker boys, sir, young-blooded sure, but they are proud nationalists, I could see no reason as to why they would lie about this.

**Minister** : What about the others? are there any other survivors?

**Marshal** : No, sir, unfortunately, our cadets guarding the station have all passed away in the bom-.

**Gregory - CPF, head of internal affairs** : The Investigation is still going on, minister, the night storm has been difficult, and temperatures have already dropped too low, To continue would mean more deaths. As far as we can tell, the two bunker boys and a station staff crew are the only survivors. We will send out searching parties for others come morning if they aren't already lost to the storm. 

**Minister** : What's our next step? 

**Political Commissar of Government body** : Minister, It seems we are at the doors, We have been handed down our cause, I believe It is now the time to let the chancellory know and rile the engines of our greater nation. 

**Minister** : Neville?

**CPF Commander - Neville** : I would advise against any action that would bring this into light, minister. Those doors are guarded by dogs, Vicious ones. We don't know the consequences of telling the chancellory, let alone anyone apart from this table, about the Vaults we found. 

**Political Commissar of Government body** : There was an explosion! We have eyewitness testimony of terrorists. What more evidence do you need? There is a state floundering at any opportunity for weakness, We need to use every advantage we have.

**CPF Commander - Neville** : The advantages may very well be our downfall. Besides, It's not a surety that those men were Zatarskis, I would haphazardly trust a drunken beggar before I would any men working in the tundra. It gets very cold out there,  I've been there during the storm, minister and I can tell you, that the state of mind of men is very different than that of one sitting in a cozy office warmed by water. It gets hard to breathe you see, so much so that the brain is deprived of enough oxygen to make men see things, Things they want to see. And we can't let such ambiguity disturb the peace we have. I suggest that we double our security and move on, and besides It's bad for business, won't you agree Mr Faulkner?

**Head of Railway Committee - Faulkner** : Quite. I agree, It would be best to put this all under a rug and forget about it. If the knowledge of this bombing were to spread, Everything would stop. The years of work we have put into diplomacy with the lower cities and access to the lucrative oil fields in the south, The GREAT DREAM. It would all be gone in an instant Rockwell.

**Political Commissar of Government body** : There are things at stake greater than filling your pockets. And what about the explosions, they just don't happen at random.

**Minister** :  And what if what jhon is saying is true? If it is a state-sponsored attack, we cannot defend miles and miles of railway tracks. and if worse, it's an all-out war, we are left only with your barebones force and the city police, which I garner isn't enough to stop an attack from the Zatarskis.

**CPF Commander - Neville** : The back channels keep me informed, minister, I don't suspect any foul play from the zatarskis of any sort. Sure, we have our few insiders engaging in espionage and theirs in our city, but it's all much under control, minister.  And even if we are hypothetically under an attack, I can assure you my men and the honourable marshal's men are enough for the city's protection. and as for the explosion - I suspect foul play from the environment, the rapid cooling and thawing have egregious effects on man-made things. It could also very well have been an accidental detonation of the explosives the construction crew carry, isn't that right Mr Faulkner?

**Head of Railway Committee - Faulkner** : quiet.

**CPF Commander - Neville** : I wouldn't worry you with it, minister.

**Political Commissar of Government body** : Let's at least investigate it. 

**CPF Commander - Neville** : I am sure the Zatarskis are digging their tunnels beneath us as we speak. 
(coy laughter around)

**Political Commissar of Government body** : Minister, as the head of the political party in the city, I implore that before you pass any judgement, we have an in-depth inquiry into the bombing, I would request we set up an enquiry committee to further investigate the situation.

**CPF Commander - Neville** : CPF can handle it in its entirety, I would adivse against raising any more brows than necessary. I am sure the news of the bombing is already running in circles. But I am sure we can spin it off as an accident, it would still hurt but it's better than the truth. Besides, Accidents happen all too often, minister, people will forget.

**Minister** : Okay, that is good enough for me, I consider this matter as finished. But Neville I want to know what happened. Faulkner, please stay back, the rest of you can take your leave.
