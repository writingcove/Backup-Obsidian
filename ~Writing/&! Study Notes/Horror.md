Case study - Texas Chain Saw Massacare - The horror really works for the movie even though it's light on gore is because of mulitple factors such as - Interesting editing, art house cinematography, docuseries style filming, and when it comes to the sawyers they don't feel like out of this world cartoons but something that very well could be a part of our world and that scares us, a way that's done is by setting the previous characters you meet as more on the saner part of the spectrum of sane people as compared to the sawyers but still believebly weird. It's a soft build up to the family, like a road trip rather than teleporting. It's that grungy feeling that scares you. Day horror movies are generally scary for me, because those who dare use it are generally very good at using it.


There is a difference between horror and misery

I know you already know this, but leaving things as a mystery are 99% more compelling than the mystery.
