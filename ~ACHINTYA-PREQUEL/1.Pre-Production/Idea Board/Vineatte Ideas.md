Vieattes could be a representation of the horrors the characters had to face 

Some vineattes are interconnected and tell a simillar story, maybe about a serial killer.

- a recursive room scenario, being trapped in a loop.
- a scenario where a creature is tailing you quietly, but we give the player some clues here and there with souds. It shouldn't be very evident but if you pay close attention you can hear it's breathing stalking you. Like the moment you are sitting on your toilet and you are bored and then you suddenly hear breathing noises through the gap of the door. But it cannot be a moment when the player expects it, so it must tailored to happen at different opportunities. Maybe when he is checking his inventory the player can slowly start hearing sniffing that grows louder. So first we will aquaint the player with no noise when inventory open but when the scenario starts - as long as the player keeps the inventory open the breathing becomes louders.
- Something approaching while scratching hard at something or you approach something that scratching hard at something
- The vineattes we meet, a group of people serving, have their own tale of a monster - like candy man feeling.  
- follow up of above - a woman with golden hair representing fire, real story is her actually being on fire  
- a vineate about a man obsessed with doing something to the point of other's misfortune but with no regret. Kinda like a mad scientist bent hell to do something  
- Head on a stick serial killer 
- A cannibal cult resorting to cannibal without realising that there was food they could eat the entire time, some theme of not looking enough or trying hard enough before turning on each other
- A bear like demon  
- Leeches
- Vikram and vetal - mischievous entity, inhabits a dead body and asks riddles. Appearing in places
- Indian folk horror
- An organisation/AI keeps on doing what they were tasked to even after society falls.
-   A society of people without faces. Forcibly taken from them. Starro suicide squad
