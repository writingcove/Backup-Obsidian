Before time was… before entropy… an entity itched to create…

They were Ah’thra.

Deep within the murky black void of reality lay Ah'thra.  Their reality was a violent one, they resided where nothing had form or meaning, where there was no time, where there were no laws dictating processes. There was only veiled chaos, whispers of distant perceived pasts and them. Blind, mute, deaf and rid of everyother sense other than thought, ah'thra wallowed in the giref of this everprevalence. Dreams were their only reprieve









In this totality of their isolated existence, Ah’thra longed for something, some meaning, and control.

It was an accident, when Ar’thra first discovered their gift of creation, they had created amorphous immaterial by accident. From then, Ar’thra quickly learned the intricacies of the art of creation and created more complex items and processes. Satisfied with their progress, Ar’thra decided.

They would create life.

But what was life? Ar’thra pondered. The concept of life was an instinctual thought they had had many times before, but could never understand.

Maybe, it was for them to now find out.

Ready, Ar’thra began, first, they forged time — a way to propagate universal processes, in an imitation of what they assumed, were machinations of their mind. Then, in the image of their nebulous body, they forged a vast infinite plane of existence, called the ether.

And Finally, Ar’thra created the centre stage for their life, A spherical planetary body.

They called it Zilea.

Though this “Zilea” had form, it had no life. To give it life, Ar’thra cut a small part of their own body and shattered it into a thousand pieces, that then rained on Zilea.

Soon life began to sprout from the shards. Ar’thra could hear them, but not see them. in fits of passion, they had forgotten about light, and so Ar’thra cut another three parts of her body. They would become moons around Zilea and would light it up.

Now, fruitful, Ar’thra could see, the birth of life.
