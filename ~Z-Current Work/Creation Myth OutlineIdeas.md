Arthra is trapped in a jail
but there is no escpae to the jail
time doesn't exist so arthra has to experience everything all at once

they want to do something, something

she dreams a lot, dreams are the only relief from the pain of existence
her dreams are special, things she dreams can happen
she usually dreams of dying

but she decides to change the pace
she thinks of something other than herself
she first thinks of something nonshapy, she create by mistake she does this by mistake
but then she tries again and again to do it
she starts learning how to create more complex things
and one day she feels like she wants to create something that will not exist forever, she wants to create something like her, something that could be short lived. but she wants to set boundaries for them. She doesn't want them to be completely ill with their existence also so she gives them time, a way to 
she gifts them time
she dreams of all mighties that come into existence but with time as a constraint. they intern start creatign things and soon there is limited life.
she is happy to see 
but it's all over in an instant
she does it again
going back to sleep again and again creating life again and again forever.
she is conflicted and surprised at the irony of the cycle of inifinity but she likes it so she continues.
